```

## Module Reference

### Active Scanner (`active_scanner.py`)

The active scanning component performs direct scanning of targets to identify technologies and potential vulnerabilities.

```python
from backend.integrated_system.active_scanner import ActiveScanner

scanner = ActiveScanner()
results = scanner.scan_target("example.com")
technologies = scanner.extract_technologies(results)
```

### Passive Monitor (`passive_monitor.py`)

The passive monitoring component identifies technologies without direct scanning, using techniques like HTTP header analysis and signature matching.

```python
from backend.integrated_system.passive_monitor import PassiveMonitor

monitor = PassiveMonitor()
results = monitor.monitor_target("example.com")
technologies = monitor.extract_technologies(results)
```

### NVD Integration (`nvd_integration.py`)

This component integrates with the NVD API to provide comprehensive vulnerability data and predictions.

```python
from backend.integrated_system.nvd_integration import NVDIntegration

nvd = NVDIntegration()
vulns = nvd.get_vulnerabilities_for_technology("apache", "2.4.51")
recommendations = nvd.get_remediation_recommendations("nginx", "1.20.1")
```

### CVSS Analyzer (`cvss_analyzer.py`)

Provides detailed analysis of CVSS vectors from NVD data, extracting vulnerability characteristics and assessing financial impact.

```python
from backend.ml.remediation.cvss_analyzer import parse_cvss_vector, assess_financial_impact

cvss_data = parse_cvss_vector("CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H")
impact = assess_financial_impact(cvss_data)
```

### Integrated Analyzer (`integrated_analyzer.py`)

The core component that combines all other components to provide comprehensive vulnerability analysis.

```python
from backend.integrated_system.integrated_analyzer import IntegratedAnalyzer

analyzer = IntegratedAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.analyze_target("example.com")
report = analyzer.generate_report(results, format="text")
```

## Advanced Features

### Financial Impact Assessment

The system assesses the potential financial impact of vulnerabilities based on CVSS vectors, categorizing risks into areas such as:

- Data breach risk
- Operational disruption
- Financial loss potential
- Regulatory risk
- Remediation complexity

### Exploit Intelligence

FinGuardAI checks for vulnerabilities with known exploits in the wild, providing critical intelligence for prioritizing remediation efforts.

### Vulnerability Trends

The system analyzes vulnerability trends for technologies over time, helping to identify increasing or decreasing risk patterns and inform strategic decisions.

### Enhanced Reporting

Reports can be generated in multiple formats (text, JSON, HTML) with varying levels of detail, suitable for different audiences from technical teams to executive management.

## Configuration

Configuration settings can be found in `backend/integrated_system/config.py`. Key configurable options include:

- NVD API settings
- Logging configuration
- Default scan parameters
- Default analysis parameters
- Financial sector specific settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Rate Limiting**: If you receive rate limiting errors from the NVD API, consider:
   - Using an API key
   - Reducing the number of requests
   - Increasing the cache TTL

2. **Scan Timeout**: For large or complex targets, try:
   - Reducing the scan scope (fewer ports)
   - Using a faster scan speed
   - Breaking the target into smaller components

3. **Missing Technologies**: If technologies aren't being detected:
   - Try both active and passive scanning methods
   - Add custom technology mappings in the configuration

### Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory. The primary log file is `integrated_analyzer.log`, which contains detailed information about the analysis process, API calls, and any errors encountered.
